<h4 align="center">Java library for distributed zero knowledge proof systems</h4>

___DIZK___ (pronounced */'diz…ôk/*) is a Java library for distributed zero knowledge proof systems. The library implements distributed polynomial evaluation/interpolation, computation of Lagrange polynomials, and multi-scalar multiplication. Using these scalable arithmetic subroutines, the library provides a distributed zkSNARK proof system that enables verifiable computations of up to billions of logical gates, far exceeding the scale of previous state-of-the-art solutions.

The library is developed by [SCIPR Lab](http://www.scipr-lab.org/) and contributors (see [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file) and is released under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file).

The library is developed as part of a paper called *"[DIZK: A Distributed Zero Knowledge Proof System](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/691)"*.

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype. This implementation is not ready for production use. It does not yet contain all the features, careful code review, tests, and integration that are needed for a deployment!

## Overview

This library implements a distributed zero knowledge proof system, enabling scalably proving (and verifying) the integrity of computations, in zero knowledge.

A prover who knows the witness for an NP statement (i.e., a satisfying input/assignment) can produce a short proof attesting to the truth of the NP statement. This proof can then be verified by anyone, and offers the following properties.

- **Zero knowledge** - the verifier learns nothing from the proof besides the truth of the statement.
- **Succinctness** - the proof is small in size and cheap to verify.
- **Non-interactivity** - the proof does not require back-and-forth interaction between the prover and the verifier.
- **Soundness** - the proof is computationally sound (such a proof is called an *argument*).
- **Proof of knowledge** - the proof attests not just that the NP statement is true, but also that the prover knows why.

These properties comprise a **zkSNARK**, which stands for *Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge*.
For formal definitions and theoretical discussions about these, see [BCCT12] [BCIOP13] and the references therein.

**DIZK** provides Java-based implementations using Apache Spark [Apa17] for:

1. Proof systems
    - A serial and distributed preprocessing zkSNARK for *R1CS* (Rank-1 Constraint Systems), an NP-complete language that resembles arithmetic circuit satisfiability. The zkSNARK is the protocol in [Gro16].
    - A distributed Merlin-Arthur proof system for evaluating arithmetic circuits on batches of inputs; see [Wil16].
2. Scalable arithmetic
    - A serial and distributed radix-2 fast Fourier transform (FFT); see [Sze11].
    - A serial and distributed multi-scalar multiplication (MSM); see [BGMW93] [Pip76] [Pip80].
    - A serial and distributed Lagrange interpolation (Lag); see [BT04].
3. Applications using the above zkSNARK for
    - Authenticity of photos on three transformations (crop, rotation, blur); see [NT16].
    - Integrity of machine learning models with support for linear regression and covariance matrices; see [Bis06] [Can69] [LRF97] [vW97].

### Why Java?

This library uses Apache Spark, an open-source cluster-computing framework that natively supports Java, Scala, and Python. Among these, we found Java to fit our goals because we could leverage its rich features for object-oriented programming and we could control execution in a (relatively) fine-grained way.

While other libraries for zero knowledge proof systems are written in low-level languages (e.g., [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark) is written in C++ and [bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman) in Rust), harnessing the speed of such languages in our setting is not straightforward. For example, we evaluated the possibility of interfacing with C (using native binding approaches like JNI and JNA), and concluded that the cost of memory management and process inferfacing resulted in a slower performance than from purely native Java execution.

## Profiler

Using Amazon EC2, the profiler benchmarks the performance of serial and distributed zero-knowledge proof systems, as well as its underlying primitives.
The profiler uses `spark-ec2` to manage the cluster compute environment and a set of provided scripts for launch, profiling, and shutdown.

### Spark EC2

To manage the cluster compute environment, DIZK uses [`spark-ec2@branch-2.0`](https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2/tree/branch-2.0).
`spark-ec2` is a tool to launch, maintain, and terminate [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) clusters on Amazon EC2.

To setup `spark-ec2`, run the following commands:
```$xslt
git clone https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2.git
cd spark-ec2
git checkout branch-2.0
pwd
```

Remember where the directory for `spark-ec2` is located, as this will need to be provided as an environment variable for the scripts as part of the next step.

### Profiling scripts

To begin, set the environment variables required to initialize the profiler in [init.sh](src/main/java/profiler/scripts/init.sh).
The profiling infrastructure will require access to an AWS account access key and secret key, which can be created with
the [instructions provided by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).

```$xslt
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={Insert your AWS account access key}
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={Insert your AWS account secret key}

export AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME="{Insert your AWS keypair name, e.g. spark-ec2-oregon}"
export AWS_KEYPAIR_PATH="{Insert the path to your AWS keypair .pem file, e.g. /Users/johndoe/Downloads/spark-ec2-oregon.pem}"

export AWS_REGION_ID={Insert your AWS cluster region choice, e.g. us-west-2}
export AWS_CLUSTER_NAME={Insert your AWS cluster name, e.g. spark-ec2}

export SPOT_PRICE={Insert your spot price for summoning an EC2 instance, e.g. 0.1}
export SLAVES_COUNT={Insert the number of EC2 instances to summon for the cluster, e.g. 2}
export INSTANCE_TYPE={Insert the instance type you would like to summon, e.g. r3.large}

export DIZK_REPO_PATH="{Insert the path to your local DIZK repository, e.g. /Users/johndoe/dizk}"
export SPARK_EC2_PATH="{Insert the path to your local spark-ec2 repository, e.g. /Users/johndoe/dizk/depends/spark-ec2}"
```

Next, start the profiler by running:
```$xslt
./launch.sh
```

The launch script uses `spark-ec2` and the environment variables to setup the initial cluster environment.
This process takes around 20-30 minutes depending on the choice of cluster configuration.

After the launch is complete, upload the DIZK JAR file to the master node and SSH into the cluster with the following command:
```$xslt
./upload_and_login.sh
```

Once you have successfully logged in to the cluster, navigate to the uploaded `scripts` folder and setup the initial cluster environment.

```$xslt
cd ../scripts
./setup_environment.sh
```

This creates a logging directory for Spark events and installs requisite dependencies, such as Java 8.

Lastly, with the cluster environment fully setup, set the desired parameters for benchmarking in [profile.sh](src/main/java/profiler/scripts/profile.sh) and run the following command to begin profiling:
```$xslt
./profile.sh
```

## Benchmarks

We evaluate the distributed implementation of the zkSNARK setup and prover.
Below we use *instance size* to denote the number of constraints in an R1CS instance.

### libsnark *vs* DIZK

We measure the largest instance size (as a power of 2) that is supported by:

- the serial implementation of PGHR‚Äôs protocol in [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)
- the serial implementation of Groth‚Äôs protocol in [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)
- the distributed implementation of Groth's protocol in **DIZK**

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9260812/43099291-9203db9a-8e76-11e8-8d68-528d903500e1.png" width="68%"></p>

We see that using more executors allows us to support larger instance sizes,
in particular supporting billions of constraints with sufficiently many executors.
Instances of this size are much larger than what was previously possible via serial techniques.

### Distributed zkSNARK

We benchmark the running time of the setup and the prover on an increasing number of constraints and with an increasing number of executors.
Note that we do not need to evaluate the zkSNARK verifier as it is a simple and fast algorithm that can be run even on a smartphone.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9260812/43099290-91ec40c0-8e76-11e8-8391-c30fbddc4acd.png" width="67%"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9260812/43099289-91d1d2b2-8e76-11e8-9a25-f06103903290.png" width="59%"></p>

Our benchmarks of the setup and the prover show us that:
 
1. For a given number of executors, running times increase nearly linearly as expected, demonstrating scalability over a wide range of instance sizes.

2. For a given instance size, running times decrease nearly linearly as expected, demonstrating parallelization over a wide range of number of executors.
